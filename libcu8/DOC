Introduction

    This document documents the functions provided by libcu8, and specify
    their behaviours.

Initialisation function

     Synopsis 
     
             int libcu8_init(const char*** argv)

          The libcu8_init() function provides initialization for libcu8. 
          Upon a call, libcu8_init() tries to allocate memory for libcu8 
          internal states, and try to inject libcu8 modified function into 
          msvcrt functions. It is also an easy way to get the utf-8
          encoded argument array (usually called argv).
          
     Parameters
     
        - ***argv : A pointer to an array of strings parameters of the program
          that will be allocated by the libcu8_init() function. It may be NULL
          if no program parameters are needed.

     Return value

          Upon succesfull return, the return value is 0. If an error occured,
          the return value is non 0.
          
File encoding management functions

    To handle safely files from different encoding, libcu8 provides functions
    to set the source encoding of files. That is, whenever a file is not
    encoded using utf-8, it is possible to specify an appropriate source
    encoding that libcu8 will use during any reading/writting operations on
    files. In the following part of this document, we refer to the source
    encoding as the ANSI encoding.
    
     Synopsis 
     
             void libcu8_get_fencoding(char* enc, size_t size);
             int libcu8_set_fencoding(const char* enc);

          The libcu8_get_fencoding() and libcu8_set_fencoding() are used to
          retrieve and set libcu8 global ANSI encoding.
          
     Parameters
     
        - *enc : A pointer to a null terminated-string that will set a new
          ANSI encoding (libcu8_set_fencoding) or recieve the current ANSI
          encoding (libcu8_get_fencoding).
        
        - size : The length (in bytes) of the array pointed by *enc.
        
     Return value

          libcu8_get_fencoding() always succeeds.
         
          libcu8_set_fencoding() returns 0 on success, non-zero on error.
     
     Note
     
          By default, the ANSI encoding is utf-8 (ie. no conversion at all).

Encoding conversion functions

    Libcu8 provides a bunch of functions to convert string from one encoding
    to another easily. Theses functions use libcu8 global ANSI encoding.
    
     Synopsis 
     
             char* libcu8_convert(int mode, char* src, size_t size,
                                       char* remainder, size_t* rcount,
                                              size_t rlen, size_t* converted);
             char* libcu8_xconvert(int mode, char* src,
                                            size_t size, size_t* converted);

          Both functions convert a string from one encoding to another one.
          However, libcu8_xconvert() assumes that the source string has only
          complete utf-8 characters, while libcu8_convert() can be used to
          handle incomplete characters.
          
     Parameters
     
        - mode : A constant describing the conversion mode. It must be one of
          LIBCU8_TO_U16, LIBCU8_FROM_U16, LIBCU8_TO_ANSI, LIBCU8_FROM_ANSI.

        - *src : A pointer to the string to be converted.
        
        - size : The size (in bytes) of the string pointed by *src.
        
        - *remainder : A pointer to a buffer that will provide non-terminated
          characters at the begining of conversion and recieve non-terminated
          characters at the end of the conversion.
        
        - *rcount : A pointer to the length (in bytes) of non-terminated 
          characters in the buffer pointed by *remainder, at the beginning and
          the end of translation.
        
        - rlen : The largest amount (in bytes) of available space in the
          buffer pointed by *remainder
        
        - *converted : A pointer to the number of bytes converted during the
          translation.
          
     Return value

          libcu8_xconvert() and libcu8_convert() return a pointer to a buffer
          holding the translated string, which must be freed when no more
          needed. If an error occurs, both functions return NULL.
          
File buffering in text mode

    When using files in text mode, libcu8 uses an internal buffer to store
    uncomplete characters that input or output function are provided with.
    This behaviour as little consequences on functions like tell() that
    will only return character-begin positions.
    
Examples

    A bunch of simple examples can be found in the sub-directory test/.
