# Thanks #

This is a list of people and contributors I would particularly like to thank 
for their help on the project. Without them, pBat would certainly not be so 
advanced today.

* Teddy Astie \(aka TSnake41\)

  * Originated the new build system that we use to build pBat, which is way 
    more easy to use than this awkward GNU autotools stuff.

  * Lots of new bugs of the interpretor submitted particularly using the well 
    known command darkbox and the httpBat script he and Xenoxis designed.

  * Lots of interpretor testing

  * Contributions to the interpretor code. Designed the Pushd Popd sections of 
    pBat.

  * Providing various programs intended to work with pBat.

* IK\_DC - Xenoxis

  * Lots of bugs submitted

  * Created designs for the new html man pages and pBat website

  * Programmed the VER command.

* Karanveer Chouhan \(aka KVC\)

  * Help reviewing of pBat

  * Provided the translations for Hindi.
