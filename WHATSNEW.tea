{{What's New ?}}

This a list of fixed bugs and improvements made :

{NOTE} : This list is not a complete list of improvements. The changes made before
October 2012 were not included since the version started in this dates used almost
new code.

{{Friday 11st, October 2012}}

	- Added welcome screen (Two versions).

	- Fixed a parsing bug (The Function Dos9_ParseStream() always returned
	  NULL).

	- Added initialisation routine ( main() ).

	- Added support for testing existing files or dirs.

	- Added support for current directory.

{{Thursday 6th, December}}

	- Added support of end of line.

	- Added commutator '/n' to the command line.

	- Added support for echoing.

	- Sorted code files for a better understandability.

{{Friday 4th, Junuary, 2013}}

	- added several commands (TYPE/MORE, CLS, COLOR, TITLE, GOTO).

	- added support for english and french.

{{Thursday 11th, February}}

	- added api function for file matching (i.e. paths using '*' and '?').

	- added function for cross-platform console management.

	- added function to extended strings.

{{Wednesday 20th, February}}

	- fixed many portabiility issues for api.

	- api is now cross-platform.

	- Dos9 now works pretty well on linux.

	- added lot of support for linux.

	- fixed a bug with vars under linux.

	- thought about use of dynamic files to easily change language.

	- Dos9 runs 'Dos9_Auto.bat' at launch, that initializes Variables to be
	  Cross-platform.

	- Dos9 has now 3 native variables :

		-- %DOS9_OS% : The operating system that is currently running
		  Dos9.

		-- %DOS9_VERSION% : The version of the running Dos9.

		-- %DOS9_PATH% : The path of Dos9 interpreter.

{{Monday 11th, March}}

	- Solve many portability issues (i.e some programs did not work under
	  Linux).

	- Reprogrammed whole Man utility, which has been named "dman" to avoid
	  confusion on POSIX-compatible Systems.

		-- DMan is able to run on several platforms natively.

		-- DMan is more simple to use, since it makes it possible to
		  use links man pages.

	- Fixed some bugs on BatMan.

	- BatMan is now mainly portable.

	- Fixed a bug in delayed variable expansion.

{{Thursday 11th, April}}

	- Corrected support of delayed expansion that didn't match to the way
	  cmd.exe parses it.

	- Added support of expression evaluating (might migrate to GNU
	  LibMathEval soon).

	- Added new kind of page support for dMan, it uses now a zip-compressed
	  file that contains several pages and saves up disk.

	- Added a console-side text editor (an alternative to BatMan), GNU Nano.

	- Modified nano to highlight batch code.

	- Fixed a bug in a parameter for delayed expansion
	  (cEnableDelayedExpansion was not taken account).

{{Thursday 12th, September}}

	- Added UTF-8 support.

	- Added different packages :

		-- Dos9 Project HLP : A man page viewer.

		-- Dos9 Project TEA : A simple, fast and tiny text processor.

		-- Dos9 Project DUMP : A hex-dumper.

	- Added i18n support (through GNU gettext).

	- Added a README file.

{{Tuesday 17th, September}}

	- Fixed bug with the message {Error : "..." is not recognized as ...}
	  message in linux version.

	- Fixed bug with the wait() function in that made the program hold
	  indefinitely.

{{Thursday 16th, October}}

	- Changed build architecture. Now, the package can be built through
	a single command line, that build all dependencies, i.e.:

${Make -B}

	- Added a lock specifier to the structure STREAMLVL that enables to fix
	bugs with nested redirection levels. Like those that occured running the
	following script:

${IF 1==1 (
	ECHO This goes to file2
	ECHO This goes to file1 > file 1
	ECHO This goes to file2, again
) > file 2}

	- Added a kind of old allocated ESTR structure reuser, that avoid reallocating
	new estr structures. (Saves up speed).

{{Sunday 27th, October}}

	- Some bug fixes, including a bug that appeared with {%~A}.

	- Added primary support of {FOR} loops (ie. simple for loop without options).

{{Friday 13th, December}}

	- Solved some bugs in libDos9 (a hazardous non initialized var)

	- Added support {FOR /F} loops with files as input.

{{Thursday 2nd, January 2014}}

	- Corrected {Dos9_ScriptCommand.c} bugs in which the delayed expansion was not executed
	even if it was enabled.

	- Corrected some manual page

	- added some translated pages

	- added new {make} system.

	- added expressions (both {interger} and {float} mode) for the {SET /A} command.

	- added {FOR /F} loop support with string as input.

	- added support for top-level blocks.

{{Thursday 14th, January}}

	- added final support of {FOR /F} including the use of command outputs as {FOR}
	input.

	- added {DOS9_SEARCH_NO_CURRENT_DIR} which does not include the pseudo directories
	'..' and '.'.

	- corrected a compatibility bug with {cmd.exe}: {DIR /b} returned the pseudo directories
	'..' and '.'.

	- corrected an expansion bug with {%%~a} (and similar var because the interpretor missinterpreted
	the command if, for example {%%~ax} was badly expanded if {%%x} was not defined). Now, the choosed varaible
    is the largest match defined.

	- corrected bug with simple {FOR} processing.

	- added partial support of {FOR /R}. (Note: this is provided for compatibility purpose, and that new scripts
	should not use theses switches any-more.)

	- added version information as a header file, making version management easier.

	- added a function to be executed automatically on exit.

	- some minor bug fixes.

	- some manual pages enhancement.

{{Wednesday 15th, January}}

	- fixed a bug that prevented both {FOR /R} and {FOR /D} to be executed the right way.

	- fixed a bug with use of {.} in file searches.

{{Friday 17th, January}}

	- Fixed a bug that caused some particular redirections to be misinterpreted, particularly,
	in blocks {(echo test>NUL)} triggered an error, because the output was interpreted to be
	a redirection to file {NUL)}. This has been solved, and both '(' , '|' and '&' operators
	are know prioritary.

	- Modified version information management. Now version are numbered in the following way:
	{YYYY.major.minor[tag]}. Where :

		-- {YYYY} : Is the year the version was released.

		-- {major} : The major version of {Dos9}.

		-- {minor} : The minor version of {Dos9}.

		-- {tag} : An optional character, meaning :

			--- {d} : Developer version.

			--- {b} : Beta version.

	- Fixed problem with broken make.

	- Enhanced features of {FILELIST*} functions of libDos9. Search is now quicker. It also resulted in
	better execution times of the {FOR /R} function (even though still deprecated).

{{Monday 20th, January}}

	- Corrected a but that caused line like {:: comment & command} to execute the command
	{command}, unlike {cmd.exe}'s behaviour.

	- Added {REM} command and comments manual page.

	- Fixed broken make that did not build {DUMP} command.

	- Added endianness support to {DUMP} command.

	- Behaviour of {Dos9} is now the same as {cmd.exe}'s one towards block.

	- Fixed a bug that required both {@} and {:} signs to be at first column.

	- Fixed a bug that prevented redirection to be executed in a top-level block.

	- Added copyright notice to all manual pages.

	- Fixed a bug with an added extra space with redirection placed at end of
	input line.

{{Thursday 23th, January}}

	- Fixed a bug with the {TITLE} command. The {TITLE} command set a title that
	was the whole command line (including {TITLE} statement).

	- Fixed a bug with the {FILELIST} features. It now works as expected with both
	'/' (filesystem root sign) and '[driveletter]:/' with windows.

{{Friday 24th, January}}

	- Started working on an enhanced version of {TEA} text preprocessor.

{{Saturday 1st, February}}

	- Final version of {TEAv2}. Added support for both {HTML 5}, {HTML 4.01} and
	{xHTML}. Others formats have been dropped.

	- Fixed a bug with the parsing of command line parameter. If, the final parameter
	was enclosed in quotes (simple or double), it resulted in undefined behaviour.

	- Fixed a bug that prevented user from include pipes in {FOR /F} command input.

	- Enhanced pipe features.

	- Fixed a bug that caused the following message

	${Error : Unable to release mutex}

	@- to be printed at exit, due to an undefined behaviour with {atexit()} function.

{{Friday 7th, February}}

	- Fixed a bug of {SET /P} subcommand. The bug caused a SEGFAULT to be raised on
	execution.

	- Fixed a major bug that prevented command search to be executed normally, it
	returned the shortest match available instead of the largest available one.

	- Added an error message if the {SET} command is unable to set environment variable.

{{Wednesday 12th, February}}

	- Fixed a bug of {SET /P} subcommand, that didn't not removed the carriage return at the
	end of the input.

{{Thursday 13th, February}}

	- Found a bug that occurs when using {CD} command from inside a batch script, if the path
	to the script given is relative, {Dos9} tries to open it in the new current path, and
	fail, or execute a different script depending on circumstances. This is to be fixed in next
	release (that will include a bunch of improvements, like {CALL}, I hope).

{{Friday 14th, February}}

	- Started working in version {2014.0.8}, a version that will include more features, (including use
	of intelligent help browsing, and improved command searching (through a own procedure, instead
	of what was used previously).

	- Fixed a bug with multiple lists in {TEA} html mode.

	- Added own function to search files in path. It is not used everywhere though.

{{Friday 21th, February}}

	- Added support of new threaded function, through a particular header.

	- The issue of uncontrolled sub-threads that continued to be executed was a major concerns, this is
	fixed thanks to the new thread functions.

	- Solved some errors that occurred when forcing binary input. A few too hopeful assumption were
	corrected, so that the interpretor will not fail if a binary file (e.g. randomly generated bytes,
	such as executables) is given as batch script, it will just printf a few (or more) errors messages
	at the prompt.

{{Monday 24th, February}}

	- Solve a bug that prevented correct {%ERROLEVEL%} values from being correctly used, it used to
	be ignored when using internal commands.

	- Decided of a change in the way to deal with variables, in order to enable more compatibility between
	{Dos9} and {CMD.exe}. The changes resides in the way var and special vars are parsed.

	@- On the one hand,
	to make the difference between the two kind of variables, I decided the only way to denote a special var
	(ie. like {%%A}) is to prefix it with two percent. Except for variables like {%0, %1} and so on, which can
	be accessed with a single {%} for compatibility purposes. This new conventions provides more stylished script
	and prevent name clashes, (ie. unexpected behaviour caused for exemple by the following code) :

${ECHO %1 test%
:: since spaces in variables names are valid, the result can
:: be unexpected depending whether "%1" or "%1 test%" are
:: expanded first.
}

	@- On the other, the only way to specify environment variables is the conventionnal way, with single {%}. Note
	that this behaviour has also changed, undefined variables will be replaced by a void string (they'll be just stripped
	from the output).

	@- Finally, in some cases, using {%a} to specify the special variable will work either, but well, it can just happen
	on a very few cases, so that it is preferable not to use this notation.

	- Changed {Dos9} behaviour towards {%0, ..., %9} variables. Those which are not explicitelly specified at startup will
	be filled with an empty string, and will expand to the empty string.

{{Thursday 25th, February}}

	- Finalized behaviour change for variables. Singles {%} are now split from the input at parsing, exception made for
	the special variables {%0, ..., %9} for which the use of a single percent is still valid (for compatibility purposes)
	as stated previously. This prevent users from using single '%' to denote a special var other than these specified
	previously.

	- Fixed a bug that made {SET /P} subfunction to return inconsistent {%ERRORLEVEL%} codes. In fact, it was
	the reverse of normal behaviour, that is :

		-- Returning {-1} on error.

		-- Returning {0} on success.

	- Added an example of batch powered by Dos9, a multifunction caculator using both floating point arithmetics and
	integer arithmetics.

{{Thursday 6th, March}}

	- Changed the behaviour of the function which decide wether the command is multiline or not. It now correctly handles
	parenthesis that are not multiline. For example, the following code used to be expected to continue on next lines :

${echo(some test&if 1 equ 1 echo some other test}

	@- However, this behaviour is not actually resolved, indeed, some error might occurs (in some very special case) if the
	previous is run. This is still to be fixed.

	- Added more compatible version of {ECHO} command. The command now tolerates various non-mainstream syntax (ie. using
	other characters than '.' to force print). The following variants are accepted :

${echo!
echo"
echo#
echo$
echo%
echo&
echo'
echo(
echo)
echo*
echo+
echo,
echo-
echo.
echo/
echo[
echo\
echo]
echo^
echo_
echo`}

	@- Most of these syntax are however not recommended, because they can cause obvious syntax errors, and are only
	provided for compatibility purposes.

	@- The characters that were given are those specified by the {ISO-C 90} standard, so that some locale may provide
	additional characters.

	- Switched to {Autoconf} build system. This allows more standard builds, with {GNU} build toolchain. It can be
	compiled through a {*NIX}-shell typing:

${./configure
make}

	@- The install target is not supported yet. It also does not use {Automake}, since it is hard to see the point
	of writing awful Makefile.am in order to produce a Makefile that can be written by hand.

{{Friday 7th, March}}

	- Started to work on a safer block determination. This should not be to difficult to obtain.

	- Started to refresh a large part of the core, which includes rewriting what were called modules, and are now
	just outdated piece of code. I hope those changes to be functional within a short delay. It is mainly about getting
	rid of old and ugly pieces of codes i've been writing about two years ago. Some function have also been transfered to
	libDos9, this is limited however, since Dos9 is not stable enough to get it in a whole library.

{{Saturday 8th, March}}

	- Added brand new parser, and also, brand new file reader. The new implementations are much more safe and elegant.
	Lots of repetitions in the code have be gathered into singles function to make it more maintainable.

	- Silenced {Dos9_Jump.c}, but hoping to get it works within a short time.

	- Added new string search based that take account of escaped-characters (ie. Characters preceded by '^').

	- Lots of bugfixes, particularly with the new parser and reader.

	- {Dos9} is much more unstable than it was, but it is to be fixed quickly since new version are easier to maintain.

	- Changed behaviour of function than are used to get command-line arguments. It already did line delayed expansion,
	but is include now unescaping (ie. removing '^'). Thus some syntax have became valid, such as :

${echo ^!test^!}

	@- This will output {!test!}, without expanding the variable, even if {test} is defined.

	@- It is also important to note that, syntax with escaping and with quotes are {strictly} equivalent. As an example, take
	the following code :

${if foo^ bar equ "foo bar" echo YES}

    @- Using, {Dos9}, the code will output {YES}. However, {cmd.exe} will not. It as been chosen to promote the first syntax
	since it is more easy to handle and far less tricky than escaping characters with {cmd.exe}, which require an almost
	random number of '^' to escape some character.

	- Optimised {Dos9_RunBlock()} function.

{{Wednesday 12th, March}}

	- Changed behaviour of the thread functions of libDos9. The {THREAD} structure now refers to the thread ID rather than to
	a handle to that thread. This new behaviour make it possible to work with thread without left a handle on this thread opened.
	It also enables the stack to contain {THREAD} structures on both {*nix} and {windows}.

	- Added time-out to the Dos9_WaitForAllThreads function. This is useful in case of deadlocks or in case of thread that does not
	terminate.

	- Added Dos9_AbortAllThread function, that kills all remaining thread (only those that were launched through Dos9_BeginThread)

	- Added Dos9_AbortThread function, that kills a thread.

	- fixed a bug in the thread library that sometimes causes Dos9 to wait indefinitely, because function Dos9_WaitForAllThread
	and Dos9_EndThread sometimes deadlocked, in a random basis.

	- Re-enable {GOTO} function, that works now (even with cross file argument).

	- Added {TEXT-ANSI} target to the {tea} text processor. It enables creation of colourized output using ANSI escapes code.
	the use of this is native in {*nix} and requires ansicon in {windows}.

	- Fixed a bug that caused infinite loop if the file read was no more accessible. It now returns and just prints error message.

	- Fixed a bug causing {eof} not to be detected in some circumstances.

	- Fixed a bug that caused an error to be printed in the case that a script that was loaded with the {GOTO} command contained
	a {CD} command so that the file could not be retrieved because it was kept with a relative path.

{{Thursday 13th, March}}

	- Fixed bugs with the run functions. The use of {program \|\| goto error} to perform feature test is avaliable for both windows
	and *nix.

	- Fixed bugs with {Dos9_SplitPath} command in *nix.

	- Added a search in {%PATH%} and {%PATHEXT%} (only in windows) before running any command.

	- Added a redirection for command that have {.cmd} or {.bat} as extension. Those files are now executed by a sub process of {Dos9}
	instead of being loaded by {cmd.exe}.

	- Fixed bug with {Dos9_GetFilePath} function. It prevented executables that were in one of the {%PATH%} directory to be found if a
	folder with the same name was in the same directory.

	- Fixed bug with the {Dos9_FileExists} function from libDos9. It sometimes returned true for files that where in the path though
	not in the current directory.

	- Fixed a bug with several encapsulated blocks. The previous parser did not searched for block after a block was solved (this is
	is now corrected)

	- Improved block support by providing more routines and by making the code more efficient.

	- Fixed a bug in {Dos9_ExpandVar} function that was introduced build ago when rules for expansion changed. I'm affraid not to have
	seen it before.

	- Fixed a bug with {Dos9_EsCpyN} function in libDos9. If the functions with 0 as iSize argument, although the function is expected
	to produce a void string, it failed in windows, thanks to microsoft's crt implementation, that throws a SIGSEGV if the last
	parameter of {strncpy} is 0.

	- Fixed a bug with {FOR} command. The tokenizer did not behave like it is described in the documentation : If several delimiters
	were encountered in a raw, they were not skipped.

	- Fixed a bug with the {ECHO} command. The prompt line (ie. {DOS9 ...>}) was displayed whenever the {ECHO off} flag was set, on direct
	input mode.

	- Fixed a bug that caused some commands to print error messages on {FOR} commands. Most notably, the {FIND} command (or at least,
	windows's implementation) fails if there is no space at end of line, so it added automatically now.

	- Fixed a bug with {SET /A} subcommand. It prefixed variable name with a space, making the result inconsistent.

	- Made the hlp to work again, without problem, since version {0.7} and the deep changes made into {Dos9} core to get something more
	modern.

{{Sunday 16th, March}}

	- Started building a {x64} version of Dos9. I experienced troubles because of the lack of {x64} version of {MinGW}. However, I managed
	to get a distribution of mingw-w64, the {MinGW} compiler adapted for {x64}, in the TDM-gcc. The install of {libintl} (and libiconv, on
	which libintl depends) must be done by downloading packages from GNU ports, and do some tricks to get it compiled in the x64 version.
	This is actually difficult to build, and unstable as a did not perform further tests.

	- Started profiling the {Dos9} code base, looking for making {Dos9} more fast. The use of {gprof} has brought several interesting analysis.
	On the one hand, I can't get explanation why is {cmd.exe} faster for long files, although if both are run at the same time, {Dos9} perform
	about twice as much commands by second. The things to be updated are:

		-- {Dos9_EsInit} and {Dos9_EsFree} function are far too expensive. It sometimes consumes {10%} of the global time-run, thus, we removed
		parts of code from the {libDos9} library.

		-- {Dos9_GetCommandProc} is far too expensive. I'm currently looking for an alternative, such as hash function. I haven't found a good one
		yet (however), and i will probably write it by myself.

		-- I'm also to optimise the execution times of {Dos9_String.h}. Those functions are almost ubiquitous in the code, so that large parts of
		code will benefit from better execution rates. I'm especially targeting {Dos9_SearchChar} and {Dos9_SearchToken}, that account for a large
		share (about 10% time execution overall).

	@- All those test have be made for normal script optimisation, it was tested from a file that implement {goto}, {if}, {set} and {echo command}.
	I also performed some tests on {for} command, as expected, functions that are the most time consuming are not the same. Though, the functions
	i listed before were also much more time consuming than they need to be.

	- Improved efficiency of {Dos9_String.h} and {Dos9_Estr.c} from the {libDos9} library. Also disabled some piece of code that ran thread in
	some functions, that basically made them slow down. {Dos9} now achieve almost equivalent performances in {for} loops (about 100 lines/s less
	than {cmd.exe}, without further optimisation), it also reach got execution rates at script level (with about 3250 lines/s while cmd.exe runs
	at 2720 lines/s on average). It is surprisingly good because I did not even finished optimisation yet, so much better performances can be expected.

	- Fixed a bug of {IF} command. The {lss} comparison operator was interpreted as {leq}.

{{Thursday 20th, March}}

	- Started comparisons between {GCC} optimisation levels.

	- Fixed a bug introduced in the function {Dos9_SearchLastToken}. It appears that, on windows, the code runs faster using {-O2} than using {-O3}
	optimisation switches, this might be caused by processor caching, but however, this should not be expected to have the same effect on variouss
	platform however. I ended up optimisation operations there, since the functions used by gprof account for about {70%} of the execution time, so
	that I'm not sure it is reliable now. With {gprof} version, i've be able to achieve speeds of about {3700 l/s}, so the result are expected to be
	at least double. In fact, by experimenting, I got only about {4000 l/s}, which it the speed of {cmd} on my computer when it consumes about 80%-90%
	of the cpu, in random occasion, because cmd.exe's has really random performances. Instead, {Dos9} is limited to approximately {25%}.

{{Saturday 23th, March}}

	- Fixed a bug in {Dos9_SearchLastChar} function.

	- Fixed a bug with redirection that was not right dealt with. {Dos9} did not check whether several block are in a row on the same line.

	- Added some functionalities to the {cmd/hlp.bat} script, which is meant to replace old-fashioned {hlp} manual page viewer. It is basically
    designed to act as a manual page manager rather than just a viewer, by providing interfaces to build manual trees, and to get manual tress from the
	repositories at {dos9.org} (this is to be implemented later).

	- Changed names of the manual-pages subdirectories, they now match up with traditional *NIX-like local names that are widely used. Note that only useful
	locales should be implemented (at most one for every language).

{{Tuesday 25th, March}}

	- Implemented replacement for old {ENABLE/DISABLEDOS9MODE}. Instead of the variable, {Dos9} provides the {CMDLYCORRECT} options that can be
	set through {SETLOCAL}, and that enables more compatibility features for {cmd.exe}.

	- Option {CMDLYCORRECT} now affects {FOR} loops: If the option is set, then all blank lines are to be stripped for the output.

	- Changed switch to specify part of lines that are not constituted of switches but by text. It is now {//}, a bit like *NIX's {--}.

{{Wednesday 26th, March}}

	- Added a short internal documentation to get help for internal functions. These are however much tinier that the full documentation
	given in {HLP}. This is voluntary, to fit in the executable.

	- First implementation of the {CALL} command is now working. This is somewhat blurred because i've not written the full man page now,
	but it seems functional.

	- Fixed bug in Makefiles.

	- Fixed a file from libDos9 that still used old name {CALLSTACK} instead of stack.

	- Found out that in some cases, {tea} breaks unicode sequences by intruding some line feed in the file, This remains to be fixed.
	This was actually fixed quickly.

	- Fixed a bug that cause {tea} to loop infinitely if a word turned out to be to wide to fit on a single line. This is now fixed and
	long words are now split in multiple lines.

	- Fixed numerous bugs introduced by use of various encoding in the documentation, that is, some file were not built by {hlp} because
	iconv was not able to convert file from erroneous encoding. This has been fixed and all pages builds up well with {hlp}.

	- Added a couple of manual pages. It is also combined with new pages and translations.

{{Wednesday 2nd, April}}

	- Implemented aliases within Dos9

	- Added {ALIAS} command.

	- Improved robustness of {Dos9_AddCommandDynamic}.

	- Fixed some bugs with {CALL} function that was not really functional. It works much better now, but the features have not been all tested
	yet.

	- Fixed a bug that caused {%0} not to be set to the correct value by the {CALL} command. Now, the behaviour is the following:

		-- if a {label} was given, {%0} contains this label.

		-- if no {label} was given, {%0} contains the file name.

{{Tuesday 3rd, April}}

	- Updated build system, so that building {Dos9} can allmost be done without user intervention. It's as simple as typing the
	following line:

${make}

	- Switched to version {2014.0.9}, because {dos9} is becoming pretty develloped now.

{{Monday 7th, April}}

	- Fixed numerous bugs on the {GNU/Linux} version. Before that update, it
	would have been fairly difficult to make it work. I posted only fixes
	for GNU/Linux, but very few incompatibilities can be expected for
	BSD based operating systems (and anyway, the only BSD based os i've
	got is NetBSD, so that compatibility may not be achieved for other
	versions. The major fixes included are :

		-- A fix for the {autotools} build system, indeed, the old
		{configure.ac} did not appended needed libraries (for
		examples, there was confusions for {libintl}, that is included
		in {GLibc} on {GNU/linux}). I think i'll consider choosing a
		better build systems, because in facts, {autotools} adds endless
		complications even for building quite simple code. The most
		Annoying drawback is that in fact, you can't use {autoconf}
		without using {automake}, otherwise, some bugs are introduced
		that you'll never hear of reading the documentation.
		Nevertheless, we don't need using {automake} to generate
		Makefile that we could write, especially when the output
		Makefile is about hundreds of KiB, and is constituted of
		almost hacks to make it work with {make}. Thus, it's a bit
		like using a program to produce garbage. {autoconf}
		provides lots of interesting features, but these advantages are
		superseded by its drawbacks. In particular, the fact that it
		does not meet the UNIX conception standards (e.g. each program
		should do only do one thing, and do it the best), so that the
		dependencies between apparently distinct {autotools} programs
		make the developer to use all the {autotools} programs.

		-- A fix for the {Dos9} code itself. The last revisions of
		{Dos9} included a lot of features that had not been tested
		on *NIX operating systems. So that numerous incompatibilities
		were introduced along source code modification. Mainly, the
		{thread} part of {libDos9} had been left totally untested on
		real system for versions. I apologize for that, I should not
		have been waiting for such a long time to upgrade. So, fixes
		in the code that have been made are:

			--- Make wrapper around undefined symbols coming
			from windows like {stricmp} ({strcasecmp} is used
			instead).

			--- Fixed bugs from {libDos9/threads}, It caused double
			free exception for some errors.

			--- Fixed used of {strupr} in {tea}. In fact, the
			symbol for {strupr} that was intended to be used on
			{GNU/Linux} was used on {Windows} platforms instead.

			--- Fixed incompatibilities in {libDos9/file}. In fact,
			default routines for *NIX used the functions {fopen}
			to check whether a file existed or not. The bug
			was introduced because in many *NIX systems,
			directories are indeed files that can be opened.
			{libDos9} now checks for regular files using the
			{lstat} function instead.

			--- Fixed incompatibilities with environment variables.
			This issue was caused by the fact that environment
			variables are case-sensitive for *NIX operating
			systems while they are not for Windows systems. In
			fact, {Dos9} already capitalized variable names when
			variables were set, however, similar feature was not
			provided for expansion. This is now fixed.

		-- Fixes on other files, (I mean, on files that are not
		required in order to make {Dos9} runing). Those fixes include:

			--- Changed the name of the {Dos9} executable from
			{Dos9} to {dos9}. This change will have no effect on
			windows, but it is usual, however, to have command
			executable names in lower characters. I may implement
			a feature for {GNU/linux} that ignore case for the
			command line. However, I now recommend using
			uncapitalised characters for command name, if you
			need compatibility, of course.

			--- Fixed a bug with the translation system. It used
			to scan file {dos9/lang/Dos9_Help.c} instead of file
			{dos9/lang/Dos9_Lang.c}.

			--- Fixed a bug from {Dos9_Auto.bat}, the current
			version dit not included the path {%DOS9_PATH%} in
			the {%PATH%} variable, that was problematic for *NIX
			systems, however, the {Dos9} executable filename
			should be looked up by the program itself, rather
			than being included in {%PATH%}.

	- Changed the way libraries are built. They are now build from within
	the current direction, and they are located in {./lib} and headers for
	libraries are located in {./include}.

	- Fixed a bug in Makefiles that caused the manual pages to be copied
	in a wrong directory (ie. {./bin/share/man} instead of
	{./bin/share/man/man} that was wrong.

{{Thursday 10th, April}}

	- Discovered a strange bug with pipes. This bug appears when input
	have several lines, when the pipe is closed, the input is not
	restored (or, at least, the input is not split from {stdin}). In
	fact, this should not occur since when the pipe is no more redirected,
	there is no more input left. This is strange though, as this problem
	does not happen with single-lines input that appears to work fairly
	good. It appears that this is caused by buffers that are stored
	internally in the kernel of the operating systems. A solution that I
        might consider is using regular files (instead of pipes) to produce
	somewhat of a pipe effect, because I haven't actually found a way to
	override the problem.

	- Fixed a bug with the {Dos9_ParseOutput} function. It wasn't possible
	to specify {2>&1} and {> foo} simultaneously, so, you it was not
	possible to specify a redirection for {stdin} and {stdout} with
	{truncate} attribute.

{{Monday 14th, April}}

	- Added some corrections that make the pipe function quite well on both
	{GNU/Linux} and {Windows} architectures (I also tested on {NetBSD} and
	it worked pretty well, without further tests however).

	- Added a few fixes on languages, and I'm starting adding new messages
	for the {file} commands.

	- Checked build on NetBSD. I've found out that {Dos9} conforms with
	{POSIX.1-2001}. Thus, On some platform, if you want to build if, you
	may specify a configuration that defines the {_POSIX_C_SOURCE} macro,
	that is, type the configure line :

	${./configure CFLAGS='-D_POSIX_C_SOURCE=200112'}

	@- However, The NetBSD headers does not conform to {POSIX.1} and
	perform wrong function exposures, so that if you use, it, you might
	need to specify {_NETBSD_SOURCE} macro.

{{Thursday 17th, April}}

	- Added some translation message in the locale.

	- Added new manual pages and lots of fixes in the manual pages.

	- Added {SHIFT} command. It can be really easy to manage argument, now,
	however, I did not preform deep test on the command so that it might still be not reliable.

	- Added {/f} switch to {ALIAS} command. This allows user to redefine internal commands and symbols, what was
	not possible previously. I decided to let user override internal commands because I found it to be an
	interesting thing to hack around, allowing to set up replacement commands for some batch that needs enhanced
	compatibility features (although they should not need such compatibility features).

	- Fixed a bug in {Dos9_Thread.c}, threads functions were making casts from different pointer sizes, ommiting
	the pointed object were different. Thus, writing 8 bytes to a location which was supposed to be 4 bytes long,
	depending on the locations of those data in the executable (and hence depending on compilation), it could
	cause really dangerous errors, such as stack corruption for example, in some rare cases. This is now fixed,
	preventing a rare crash to actually occur.

	- This is the final build for at least a few months. I'll be very busy in the next few month, but I hope i'll
	be able to submit new fix starting in the summer holidays.

{{Saturday 20th, April}}

	- Fixed a bug that caused {Dos9} to crash if either {%PATH%} or {%PATHEXT%} (only for windows) were not in the
	command environment.

	- Corrected a bug with {tea} in {html} mode. The parser did used to escape the reserved characters {>} and {<}
	but did not care of {&}. This bug is corrected, enabling {html} codes to work perfectly well. I hadn't noticed
	it until yet because most recent browsers do not care about such errors, preventing error to be easilly
	triggered.

	- Fixed omission of {ansicon} on the {Dos9_Auto.bat}, which is launched at startup.

{{Saturday 14th, June}}

	- Following advices of guys for dostips.org, changed the delimiters and the way quotes are handled:

		-- The available delimiters are the following {(space),;(tab)}. This is now fully compatible with {cmd.exe}.
		I also introduced functions in order no to take care of some of them ({,;}) since they may be used by some
		programs for switches. (The first example I have is {gcc}, and options like:)

		${gcc -Wl,import}

		-- Changed the way quotes are handled. Quotes have now precedence over conditional operators ({\|&}) and command
		blocks ({()}). This enables to make statements more secure using quotes. The new behaviour also conforms to cmd.exe
		behaviour. Typically, the following code :

		${IF foo==foo echo  ") else ("}

		@-- was understood differently by {Dos9} and {cmd.exe}. Now, the {") else ("} is considered to be escaped, and is no
		more interpreted as a subcommand of {if}, as it did before.

		-- Chosen a standard way to handle quotation marks, an to cut parameter. In fact, any delimiter that is between
		two quotation marks is ignored. So that parameters are cut on unquoted delimiters, some example of now valid
		parameters are :

${"simple quotation"
foo="foo bar"}

		@-- and so on and so forth...

		@-- If the interpreter finds an unpaired quotation mark, then, the remaining characters are considered to be
		between quotation marks. So that, the following examples are equivalent:

${type "some file
type "some file"}

		-- behaviour of function to remove quotation marks in parameters have also changed in order to achieve more
		compatibility with {cmd.exe}. Basically, the algorithm that {Dos9} follows when removing parameters quotation
		marks is:

			--- If the parameter begin with a quotation mark, then remove it, otherwise, stop the algorithm at this
			step.

			--- If the parameter end by a quotation mark, then remove it either. But, do not remove it if the
			parameter does not begin with a quotation mark.

	- Cancelled the conversion of {Dos9} code to wide char. This was indeed far too hard (it implied modifying almost any
	piece of code), and had little advantages (huge incompatibilities between various platform, particularly for non-c99
	function that are obviously required in order to make thing working). Thus, I decided to make a wrapper over libC functions
	in order to be able to use utf-8 internally. This way, I keep the code like it is, and preserve compatibility with other
	platforms (Windows, Linux, NetBSD, DragonFly BSD, OpenBSD) and with POSIX. Moreover, this support for unicode may easily be
	removed for platforms that do not handle utf-8, or those that do it natively.

{{Monday 16th, June}}

	- Reorganized the source tree for internal commands. Before that, every file of the {command} subdirectory contained several
	different commands. I found that is was not really practical for maintaining code, the code is now split in files that contains
	each a different internal command.

	- Added a functional {/Q} switch to the {RMDIR} command. However, it is supposed to deal with the {/S} switch, which is not
	functional yet.

{{Thursday 19th, June}}

	- I eventually decided to use the GNU toolchain to compile {Dos9}. I previously expressed lots of criticism toward use of autotools,
	but libtool (which is par of the GNU toolchain) is unfortunately the only program that allows developers to deal with libraries
	(statically or dynamically linked) in a platform independent way. This is the best solution I have, but if a newer build systems that
	enables to make such things emerged, I'd be glad to move to it.

	- Changed some source file name because {automake} was complaining about overlapping objects file names. Some of the name are more
	logical, but, some are not really.

{{Tuesday 24th, June}}

	- Corrected a bug that prevented local variable (eg. like {%1}) to be
	used as argument with the {call} command, thanks to Jo15 from
	{http://batch.xoo.it|batch.xoo.it} who reported the error.

	- Added {local} target to {Makefile} that generates a local
	installation of {Dos9} inside the folder {./bin}. It is as simple as
	typing

${make local}

	- Added macros from the {gnu gettext} package. Also enabled the use of
	the --disable-nls switch for configure.

{{Friday 29th, August}}

	This is the first time I write something in this file for a long time
	now. I've been hacking around Dos9 for a little time now (haaa,
	holidays). This is a list of improvements I made during from
	24th June to today.

		- Changed behaviour of parameter handling routines, valid
	delimiter are now ",; " and tab. The way doubles quotes are handled
	changed either. An quoted expression may be constituted of an
	arbitrary long string that conforms to the following rules :

		-- Any delimiter is ignored if it is surrounded by double
	quotes.

		-- If double quote, is directly preceded or followed by an
	string characters that are not delimiter, this string is part of the
	parameter.

		-- And so on and so forth, until we reach unquoted delimiters
	on both sides of the parameter.

	@- Moreover, the quotes are removed if their position conform
	to the following rules :

		-- If a parameter begins with a double quote it will be
	removed.

		-- If a parameter ends with a double quote and begin with a
	double quote, both are removed.

		-- Else, keep the line like this.

	- Fixed some autotools options, that where never mentioned under
	mingw system.

	- Fixed incompatibilities with the IF command. Now, the {IF} command
	returns errors on case of string used as operators for {GEQ}, {GTR}
	{LSS}, {LEQ} comparants. Moreover, the interpretor is able to handle
	both hexadecimal, decimal and octal bases. Finally, implemented
	comparants for floats (same as integer comparants but prefixed with f),
	as a {Dos9} extension.

	- Fixed issues of compatibility for the SET command. It is mainly a
	matter of quotation marks handling, and typically, the issues for both
	SET /p and SET are fixed, while little issue (not for simple /a
	assignments of course) still exist for the SET /a command.

	- Some fixes for the FOR command, now enabling the use of the three
	numeric bases for all the parameters and preventing overflows in FOR /l
	loops.

	- Modified the FOR command in order to accept filename sets to be
	given as input for the FOR /F command. This puts more sense on the
	"usebackq" option.

	- Added a custom environment within {Dos9} in order to instaure
	cross-platform syntax capabilities like use of "=" in variable names
	(which is impossible on many systems), to set "=x:" variables for
	CD command.

	- Corrected a bug with SET command, wich displayed system environment
	while it was supposed to display {Dos9} custom environment.

	- Corrected a bug that prevented the FOR command from getting command
	input under any *nix OS (don't know the actual reason for this, but
	I reimplemented the code using the *nix call fork(), which is,
	frankly, much more convenient than tricky systems to communicate
	between process under windows). The command redirection now works
	pretty well on any *nix system.

	- Added a Windows specific new CD command, to be compatible with
	Windows {cmd.exe} features. The primitive version of CD is still
	shipped for *nix operating systems (concept of disk is a huge
	non-sense under Unix-like operating systems, because they represent
	filesystems like a binariy tree which root is "/", and on which
	filesystems and devices are mounted as directories).

	- Fixed a bug, that always caused wrong pid to be awaited if the
	process was forked on time through FOR /F command (with a command input)
	under *nix operating systems, resulting in a mess between commands and
	commands outputs.

	- Implemented new functions within libDos9 in order to quickly sort
	files matching to some attributes and file not matching in a single
	function call.

	- Re-implemented the TYPE command to get a command compatible with
	{cmd.exe} equivalent. The result is very closely compatible except for
	on case of name printing.

	- Implemented FIND command as an internal command. It matches closely
	cmd.exe behaviour, except for some inconsistencies I've tried to
	address (limited line length, etc).

	- Implemented the %* variable, that have been lacking in the Dos9
	implementation for a very long time (special var are implemented at
	least since 2013). However, there is still little concerns, for
	example, on Unix-like operating system it is impossible to retrieve
	the original command line (arguments are passed separated to the
	kernel). Thus, the {dos9|Dos9} tries to construct the line back the
	best it can, by putting spaces between the arguments. This is only
	an issue at startup, though, with call, it may not be a problem.

	- Changed the version number to {2014.0.9b}, I think the interpretor
	may be mature enough to think of a real release in a close time.

{{Wednesday 3rd, September}}

	- Implemented a new pipe system for Unix-like operating systems (that
	may have broken the good-old WINDOWS implementation, haven't checked
	yet). It uses full power of fork() system call and do not suffer from
	output truncation due to size of kernel's pipe buffer. Also, both
	command are now parallelized, gaining significant execution time in
	comparison to older system. This pipe system does not apply to WINDOWS
	operating system, which will benefit from a new pipe system in little
	delays.

	- Removed padding of arguments with {"} for external commands, on
	Unix-like operating systems. Indeed, padding {"} around arguments often
	cause command to fail (precisely, make the command not work the way
	you are intending to).

	- Fixed a little issue with the autotools suite. In some Unix-like
	systems, the host triplet was not reported to program. That does not
	matter a lot, anyway.

	- Definitely set libDos9 as static by default. It is indeed much more
	convenient (no installation needed on Unix-like operating systems).
	Some may object that it results in bigger executables. But most
	of time, size is not really relevant, and it save setting library
	search path anyway, thus enabling dos9 to be embedded in the a
	memory stick for example (And yeah, size ain't too relevant, because
	memory stick often have size of few GBs). Furthermore, static linking
	allows compiler to perform further optimisations, that can't be
	done with dynamic linking.

	- Fixed some bugs with the SET command that did not use the custom
	environment every time, causing the command to fail.

	- Adapted the hlp.bat script to make it work on Unix-like operating
	systems. The new scripts also uses the shift command intensively.

	- Fixed some bugs in translations. Removed the en_US local which is
	almost stupid.

{{Wednesday 24th, September}}

	- Implemented the {MORE} command as an internal command (why create
	external executables when it is so simple to add little commands to
	the interpretor ?). It includes almost every {cmd.exe} features,
	except the form-feed expanding features (never seen it used though).
	However, if you build {Dos9} with the option {--disable-console}, you
	should still encounter minor bugs, due to the lack of console
	capabilities. Finally, I thought about replacing {MORE} with {TYPE}
	when building with {--disable-console}, but it would be obviously sad
	not to benefit from this far better and new command.

	- Implemented a special stream translation system (for streams like
	{NUL}, {CON}, and so on and so forth), to get Unix name of their
	counterparts. I did not implemented the translation for all streams
	I know, though, but it won't be to annoying to be added.

	- Corrected a few bugs for Unix-like systems.

{{Tuesday 2nd, December}}

	- Corrected a bug within the {IF} command that prevented {ELSE IF}
	combination to be executed correctly. This was actually caused by
	a failure to match parenthesis the right way. It was basically making
	only the first line of the if block to be executed. Now the bug is
	solved and the result is fully functional.

	- Added two features within the {MORE} command that enable it to
	accept both UTF-8 encoded text and ansi escape codes to be mixed with
	text.

{{Thursday 6th, January 2015}}

	- Did some final arrangements that make {Dos9} ready to release on the
	GNU/Linux platforms. There is some work left for make it run under
	Microsoft Windows platforms.

	- Fixed a little bug of the {More} command under Microsoft windows.
	MS-Windows does not return line-feed characters using getch() function
	but returns untranslated chariot return (0x0D). This subtleties was
	not taken account by the {More} command, so that the enter was inactive.

	- Changed the way {Dos9} command line works; Now it's possible to use
	widespread switches like '/C' or '/K'. The way to tell the interpreter
	which option should be enabled and which should not through the command
	line has also changed.

	- Fixed minor issues due to the previous behaviour change of Dos9_GetExePath()
	that affected both {FOR} command and Dos9_RunExternalBatch() function.

	- Fixed the broken pipe system introduced by the change of pipe system
	on GNU/Linux (and most of *nices). This is not fully tested though. But
	the new way of handling pipes permits infinite length for both input
	and output of commands.

{{Tuesday 13th, January 2015}}

	- Fixed an minor issue in the {Dos9_SetEnv} function that caused some
	rare bugs that made {SET} command to raise a segfault if it was invoked
	to remove a variable from the environment. It wasn't that frequent because
	usually, variable removal didn't worked, due to another bug. This is now
	fixed.

	- Added the {START} command on Windows, That works pretty well, even if
	some parameters seem to be ignored by windows, such as {/Wait}. The
	command have few option compared to cmd's version, but, it's a good start
	point anyway.

	- Changed the version number to 214.1b, that mean, it's the beta of the
	first stable version which is expected to be released within a short
	time.

{{Tuesday 21rd, April}}

	- Fixed a minor issue in the error system for the {IF} command,
	the command used to exit the interpretor upon minor error.

	- Added number of new command to deal with files. Among this command,
	we have {MOVE}, {COPY}, {DEL}, {MD}, {RD} and some others.

	- Changed the ESTR syntax. I think it is actually easier to access
	the string by using a -> rather than an obscure macro. Moreover, it
	renders the code more simple, it add less symbols.

	- Continued French translation.

	- New and reviewed man pages. Some manual pages were clearly outdated
	as some had more than two years although the command changed. To clear
	this out, man page content as been revised to be more relevant.

	- Added a brand new Dos9 extension to the {IF} command. I found pretty
	annoying that cmd (and thus Dos9) lacked support for multiple
	conditions for a single if (e.g. logical expressions). Obviously
	this could have been done previously by using the {SET} command to
	evaluate an expression but this was time- and code-wasting. The
	interpretor currently supports only {or} and {and} logical connectors.
	These are widely sufficient for most cases, except some rare cases
	that requires you to have {xor} either. This is not a big concern, it
	is just about writing a few more code.

	@- The syntax is pretty simple, but must include blanks around
	brackets:

		-- {expression} or {expression} : True if one of the two
		expressions (at least) is true.

		-- {expression} and {expression} : True if both expressions
		are true.

		-- [ expression ] : Denotes a higher precedence.

	@- As you can see, the syntax is clear but efficient. You can use
	test that are provided by the {IF} command :

		-- {not}

		-- {defined}, {errorlevel}, {exist}

		-- {equ}, {neq}, {leq}, {geq}, {lss}, {gtr} and derivatives

	@- Note that the {IF} command only interpret expressions as such if
	they are surrounded by brackets, like in this example :

	${if [ a equ b ] echo no, seriously ?}

{{Sunday 10th, May}}

	- Some fixes for windows, specially for the CTRL+C handling routines.

{{Friday 24th, April}}

	- Fixed a few remaining bugs in the implementation of if extended
	expression. As a example, in some case, an {or} used to be computed as
	an {and}. These issues are now fixed and the command great.

	- Merged tests of the {If} command. In fact, some test were duplicated
	in different sources, but for maintainability reason, it try to give
	up with the copy and past approach.

	- Corrected an issue of the {TEA} text processor. When producing html
	output, {TEA} often failed to recognize path that refer to actual other
	{TEA} based pages and others files. One of the typical issue was
	that TEA sometimes appended ".html" to URIs (that already contained
	an ".html" anyway). Now, {TEA} also check for protocol prefixes in order
	to chose whether a ".html" suffix should be appended. Recognised
	protocols are :

	-- {http://}

	-- {https://}

	-- {mail://}

{{Thursday 7th, May}}

	- Fixed lots of man pages for the Dos9 project. Also fixed some little
	bugs in the TEA text processor, dealing with some sort of {\\} that where
	mishandled in previous patches.

	- Changed regexp implementation after discovery of some bugs (eg "test" was
	not matching "*e*s*"). The new implementation is less faulty and clearer to
	use.

	- Added a new {/e} switch to the {FIND} command (to produce somewhat similar
	to UNIX's well known {grep -e} command). It enables use of joker expressions
	on patterns. With this option {FIND} checks that the entire line matches
	the expression.

{{Thursday 2nd, June}}

	- Corrected some issues compatibility issue with the newest MinGW
	version that now defines {_POSIX_C_SOURCE}.

	- Fixed a bug with the start command. Apparently, the ShellExecuteEx
	function does care whether or not the filenames passed to it contains
	forward slashes instead of backslashes.

	- Added some little info message to the {SET} command in order to
	print the result of the expression when using {/A} slash.

{{Thursday 10th, June}}

	- Added a wrapper to the {MORE} command to make it display utf-8 text the
	way it is intended to. Indeed {windows} does not implement implement the
	fputc() function as specified by the standard and considers that it
	receive character instead of bytes.

	- Fixed a bug of the {MORE} command that caused miscomputation of utf-8
	characters number.

{{Wednesday 13th, Junuary, 2016}}

	- Added support of libcu8, a library designed to handle utf-8 efficiently
	with msvcrt in windows. This is part of a large ongoing effort that
	attempts to make Dos9 more internationalizable. To do so, We had to
	kind short-circuit msvcrt with brand this brand new library. Although
	still experimental, this works quite great.

	- Added new CHCP command to handle efficiently the new libcu8 library.

{{Monday, 25th, Junuary}}

	- Changed version of Dos9 to emphasize the important changes of Dos9 since
	new year 2016.

	- Added functions to restrict fd inheritance, to make sure the appropriate
	fds are closed on exec. It is basically usefull for FOR commands.

	- Hugely modified the libcu8 to fit with libDos9. It is still an experimental,
	though, but it works way better now.

	- Added some new behaviours in file expansion. Now, it is legal to specify negative
	offsets during variable expansion. Quickly, negative offsets refers to the absolute
	value of the offset, counted from the end of the variable. For instance, this is now
	allowed :

${%var:~-2,-1%}

{{Thursday, 28th, Junuary}}

	- Added an option that allow using switch catenated with commands, such
	as

${set/p var=question}

	- Fixed and modified hugely the dump command so that it is way more
	portable.

{{Sunday, 7th, February}}

	- Fixed some bugs with the FOR command.

	- Fixed some bugs in redirections.

	- Fixed little bugs in libcu8.

{{Thursday 18th, February}}

	- Added the '=' operator for the SET command. The operator do behave
	a little bit differently from cmd.exe's SET, but it is convenient too.
	For the moment, libmatheval only supports explicit number anyway.

{{Monday 16th, April}}

    - Modified the initialization procedure of Dos9. Dos9 can now handle two different
    startup files:

        -- {$HOME/.dos9/Dos9_Auto.bat} : user-specific startup file

        -- {$DOS9_PATH/Dos9_Auto.bat} : system-wide startup file

    - Fixed some bugs with {SET} and redirections.

    - still develloping dos9ize

    - Fixed errors with folders containing spaces for Dos9.

{{Friday 15th, July}}

	- Fixed a little bug with the for command. When the field "delims=;" is specified
	with {FOR} without "eol=" being specified, then the character ";" is not used
	as the default end-of-line character.

{{Wednesday, 14th, September 2016}}

    - Added PUSHD and POPD commands

    - Allow to list variable which match with a prefix

{{Friday 18th, October 2016}}

	- Removed the complex initialisation model set up the {16/04/2016} in favour of
	a single (somewhat read-only) {Dos9_Auto.bat} initialization script that calls
	automatically local and global custom initialization scripts.

	- Worked a lot to improve the binary tree, in order to conform to unix
	installation standard and windows, by the way. This is near to being ready.

	- Modified the {TYPE} command, adding the following features :

		-- The file names are now echoed thought the standard error output. This
		new behaviour allows sorting out easily file names and file contents. By the
		way this is also more conformant to {cmd.exe}.

		-- If no filename is specified, the {TYPE} command gets it input from the
		standard input, acting quite the same as more.

	-- Few documentation updates.


{{Tuesday 26th, October}}

	- Fixed configure.ac bug preventing autotools from properly detect
	BSD based OSes.

	- Lots of fixes for the libcu8 library, which was not working properly
	on 32-bits platform. The lib now directly asks the location of function
	using the kernel instead on relying on pointers given by the libC.

	- Some minor fixes for Dos9 in general.

	- Fixed a little hlp bug

{{Wednesday 26th, October 2016}}

	- Rewrite Pushd and Popd commands.

	- Fix some commands help.

{{Thursday 27th, October}}

	- Change location of gettext files under unices to match the usual
	file layout.

{{Friday 28th, October}}

	- Fix some compilation errors.

{{Sunday 30th, October}}

	- Improve pushd command and add documentation.

{{Tuesday 1st, November}}

	- Fixed some compilation errors with some the stat and findnext
	functions.

{{Wednesday 9th, November}}

	- Fixed some minor errors with config.h (basically expansion of datadir)

	- Fixed errors.

{{Wednesday 23th, November}}

    - Fixed compilation error in Dos9_Lang.c.

    - Add compilation command in BUILD.readme.

{{Sunday 4th, December}}

    - Fixed some major bugs submitted by Teddy Astie, for unices. Including :

    -- Errors in parsing lines containing nested for loops when braces are not explicitly
    specified. eg:

${for /l %%A in (0 1 10) do for /l %%B in (0 1 10) do (
   echo %%A %%B
)}

    -- Cleaned up zombies processes that were not wiped from kernels buffer since Dos9
    never explicitly specified to throw the data out. Basically, this behaviour is
    particularly shown when repeating for loops. eg:

${:loop
for /f "delims=: tokens=1,2,3" %%A in ('echo this:is:a_test') do (
    echo %%A %%B %%C
)
goto :loop}

    - Changed Dos9 behaviour when getting a SIGINT on Linux. Depending on whether a user
    input or a script is being executed, the interpretor choose to cancel the command
    or to exit.

{{Monday 5th, December}}

    - Fixed a bug with FIND command, the case sensitive and insensitive features were
    swapped

{{Wednesday 7th, December}}

    - Correct some words in French (fr_FR) manual.

    - Fixed errors with gotos, basically omit spaces before labels.

{{Wednesday 8th, February 2017}}

	- Fixed some bugs with the move command.

{{Thursday 9th, February}}

	- Fixed a major bug of the IF command. Before that, it had fuzzy behaviour with blocks
	that were part of a later command. Indeed, when combined with a command that required
	a block but which was not enclosed in a block, the line was poorly handled, eg:

${if a==a if b==b (
echo test
)}

	@- This example (and its derivatives) should now behave the way it is intended to, that
	is, as if it was specified as :

${if a==a (if b==b (
echo test
))}

{{Saturday 12th, February}}

	- Fixed minor bugs with the {START} command.

	- Fixed many manual pages.

    - Fixed if dos9 extension bug.

{{Monday 13th, February}}

	- Fixed libcu8 so that it runs flawlessly under windows XP. The bug consisted of a
	CRITICAL_SECTION that was wrongly initialized. A second bug involving libcu8_closedir()
	as been fixed.

	- Fixed errors with the hlp script.

{{Wednesday 15th, February}}

	- Fixed a lot of memory leaks.

	- Fixed libcu8_closedir() function. Indeed, the function did not close directory in a
	correct way.

	- Fixed libcu8_dup() functions to handle standard input the right way.

{{Friday 17th, February}}

	- Fixed libcu8 so that libcu8 ignores invalid utf-8 bytes sequences, instead of
	returning errors.

	- Fixed the FOR function freeing function.

	- Fixed some manual pages.

{{Thursday 16th, February}}

    - Update hlp.bat and man.

    - Fix a bug with some libc when display the current directory (with Echo on).

{{Wednesday 22th, February}}

	- Added a new feature to the {FOR} command that allows using regular
	expressions with simple {FOR} loops. (eg. such syntaxes are now correct)

${for %%a in (*.exe) do echo %%a}

	- Fixed an bug with the {GOTO} command that prevented error messages
	from being displayed.

	- Fixed error of the {FOR} commands that wrongly omitted {goto} effects
	or {exit /b}.

	- Modified {FOR} manual page according to the new features.

	- Added {/b} switch for the {START} command.

	- Added new feature to {START} command so that it handles empty program
	name in a way similar to what cmd does. (ie. running an instance of
	cmd /c).

	- Added styles to manual pages thanks to styles-sheets provided by
	Xenoxis.

	- Changed libDos9 functions to search files with a totally new
	implementation.

{{Saturday 25th, February}}

	- Fixed some errors with libcu8 that was unable to behave properly using
	pipe as it sometimes blocked on input.

	- Fixed wrong behaviour of the {%*} variable which contained all the
	command line, instead of containing only parameters.

	- Fixed errors with propagation of environment variables during
	application launch affecting batch and external command launch.

{{Tuesday 28th, February}}

	- Fixed libcu8 handling of pipe that did not allowed interaction
	with programs such as {darkbox}.

{{Thursday 16th, March}}

	- Fixed some error of libcu8. Sped up the library by determining when
	charset conversion is really necessary (ie. do not convert blindly
	text from utf-8 to utf-8).

	- Fixed some unspecified behaviour with the FOR command. Indeed, when
	given a command as input, the for command would not way for the
	process to complete before continuing in case of encountering {GOTO}s
	or {EXIT /b} command. This led to an unnecessary "zombie" process and
	could easily lead to unexpected behaviours since no synchronisation
	interface was provided by Dos9.

	@- This issue has been fixed by forcing Dos9 to wait for the process
	launched by {FOR} to exit before resuming execution. Note that it
	doesn't change the overall {FOR} behaviour, that is, both processes
	are ran asynchronously (ie. at the same time), which is different
	from cmd behaviour.

{{Tuesday 21th, March}}

	- Fixed some typos that caused some minor bugs depending on
	configuration.

	- Fixed a minor bug of the {DIR} command that was not ignoring
	case when dealing with disk letters.

	- Fixed a misimplementation of the {START} command when not
	using libcu8 (nor Linux).

	- Made the {/b} switch working with unices.

{{Wednesday 29th, March}}

	- Fixed some error in file search handling (the origin folder of a
	static string was not added to matches, as if DOS9_DIR_MODE was
	the default behaviour).

{{Thursday 30th March}}

	- Fixed a bug with {FOR} command that created more variable that it
	it was necessary when using a joker {*} as the final token specifier.

	- Fixed bug with {Dos9_ShowErrorMessage()} function that called the dos9
	exit function twice, causing a SEGFAULT.

	- Fixed the {START} command :

		-- Fixed problems with transmission of {Dos9} attributes.

		-- Fixed handling of the title parameter.

	- Fixed an implementation error which resulted in misinterpreted delayed
	expansion when variable name started with a number.

	- Fixed block parsing systems.

{{Sunday 2nd April}}

	- Fixed a compilation error on *NIXes.

{{Wednesday 5th, March}}

	- Fixed lots of bugs caused by the new parsing system.

	- Fixed some errors of the {for} and {call} command.

	- Fixed the {TYPE} to make it capable of handling binary files.

{{Sunday 9th, March}}

	- Fixed the expansion system to behave closely like cmd does.
	(ie. made two distinct level of special var expansion, one for
	the program parameters and one for the other conventional
	special vars).

	- Changed expansion of special var resulting from a {FOR} to
	be executed before block execution.

	- Added a safe CTRL-c handler on windows.

	- Merged po files for Dos9.

{{Wednesday 12th, April}}

	- Fixed incorrect block parsing that did not handled properly escaped
	new line characters that resulted in executing commands as if there was
	actually more commands than there are really.

	- Added some error messages and new languages message to be used for
	CTRL-c handler.

	- Fixed many typos.

	- Fixed plenty of tiny bugs.

{{Thursday 13th, April}}

	- Added new system that loads the entire script file at once, instead of
	the weird old mechanics that consisted in opening/reading/closing script
	at every new line. This achieve a great performance gain.

	- Fixed an error of the Dos9_SetFdInheritance under unices.

	- Fixed the goto command to make it able to deal with label that have
	spaces inside them.

	- Fixed a bug that prevented i10n to be enabled with simple help modules.

	- Fixed some manual pages.

	- Fixed bug that caused Dos9 not to append a / after disc in %~dpA.

	- Added a /C:MD file to generate html files compatible with pico

{{Wednesday 11th, April}}

	- Fixed error on handling {2>&1} redirection.

	- Fixed Dos9_FilePath.c error that led Dos9 to check for {file}
	before using {%PATHEXT%}.

{{Sunday 23rd, April}}

	- Changed conditional operators and redirections semantics (ie.
	conditional operators now own precedence over redirections,
	just the regular cmd-way).

	- Fixed an error with file search not using libcu8.

	- Fixed some typos on english manual.

	- Fixed compatibility issue due to msvcrt inconsistent
	structures name for {finddata} and {stat}.

    - Fixed {Dos9_RunExternalCommand()} which add a pretty big footprint on
    the stack, sometimes causing stack overflows with Musl libc.

{{Tuesday 15th, May}}

	- Added new build system based on femto.

	- Fixed text files.

	- Fixed a great lot of typos.

	- Extended documentation.

	- Added the possibility of using unix-style switches with tea due to problems
	of mingw that mangled the slash of switches.

	- Fixed a bug of the {DEL} command. If the required file refers to a dir,
	the same behaviour as the one used with {DIR} is used so that files inside
	that dir get deleted.

{{Thursday 17th, May}}

	- Fixed CTRC-C handling. Sadly the new multi-thread implementation makes it
	impossible to grab any current directory or modified environment.

{{Tuesday 22nd, May}}

	- Fixed Mutex locking error in the SET command.

	- Modify {GOTO} and {EXIT} to leave {%ERROLEVEL%} unmodified upon execution.

	- Added the local variable environment creation via {SETLOCAL} and {ENDLOCAL}.

{{Wednesday 23rd, May}}

	- Added new manual and functionalities to {START}. When calling internal
	command with {/b} option, The command is launched as an internal thread.

	- Fixed the {CD} command that without argument displayed an error message.

	- Fixed an error with file redirection inside the {FOR} command input.

	- Fixed set command SEGFAULT error when listing variables. Fixed typos
	in the manual page.

	- Added {ENDLOCAL} manual page.

	- Fixed memory leak when duplicating thread environment.

	- Fixed parsing errors that misinterpreted {2>&1} as a combination of
	a redirection and the conditional operator {&}.

	- Fixed {%~d0} variables. When file modifiers are called on the {%0}
	argument, the path used is the path of the current executed batch.

	- Fixed string search functions handling of escape {^} character. Before,
	two adjacent {^} where misinterpreted as an escape anyway.

	- Fixed error with conversion of local var blocks to unicode.

{{Friday 25th, May}}

	- Added femto-style configuration to libmatheval. Provide a @fnp@ symbol

	- Fixed some bad libiconv linking options.

	- Fixed a lot of compilation warnings.

{{Tuesday 29th, May}}

	- Fixed libintl messages directories and initialisation of current
	locale.

	- Fixed {COPY} command to be more compatible to cmd.exe. The extension
	is only enabled when {destination} is a folder or ends with a directory
	delimiter.

	- Modifyied all commands to provide more detailled errorlevel codes.
	Allmost every command used to return -1 on error,  this is not the
	case anymore. Commands now return an {%ERRORLEVEL%} value equal to
	the error code associated with the message printed.

{{Wednesday 30th, May}}

	- Fixed if behaviour to be more compatible with {cmd.exe}. It now
	supports the use of {&} and {\|} inside the if without specifying
	additional blocks.

	- Fixed broken {COLOR} command.

	- Fixed Makefile suite that erroneously linked with -lpthread when
	linking with -lm was necessary. Also fixed makefiles trying to
	build libcu8 even on linux

{{Friday 1st, June}}

    - Added a brand new editing system to the libcu8 library so that Dos9's
    utf-8 versions supports decent editing facilities like hability to insert
    characters in the middle of the input or use history.

    - Fixed a bug causing the %* variable to contain the script name if the
    script was launched as a separate thread inside an interpretor.

    - Fixed Broken makefiles for linux.

    - Fixed Broken console functions for linux.

{{Wednesday 6th}}

	- Fixed {%ERRORLEVEL%} variable which is now implemented as a read-only
	variable to avoid polluting child processes environment (especially
	cmd.exe which behaviour gets buggy when errorlevel is defined).

	- Fixed {SET /A} command to be able to specify expression containing
	spaces.

	- Fixed {SET} default behaviour that provided an extension breaking the
	original command behaviour. The only behaviour used then is the old
	cmd behaviour that truncate the input. Fixed the manual page also.

	- Fixed {Dos9_RunCommand()} and added {Dos9_Exec.c} to provide a more
	reliable support for external command and the {START} command.

	- Fixed {FIND} command to provide ErrorLevels compatible with cmd.exe,
	(ie. 0 means "match found").

	- Modified history behaviour of libcu8.

	- Fixed broken thread function preventing correct exit values from
	being reported to parent threads.

	- Fixed {CALL} function to include search in {%PATH%} and {%pathext%}
	if available on the system when calling file or batch. Also fixed a
	bug that omitted the 10th parameter if more then 10 parameters were
	given

	- Re coded {START} command.

	- Enabled version 218.2.

{{Friday 8th}}

	- Fixed segmentation fault happening when calling a batch file with no
	arguments and calling the {SHIFT} command from within the script
	subsequently.

	- Fixed {START} command to detect batch files extension {.bat} and {.cmd}
	and start the appropriate {Dos9} interpretor instead of {cmd.exe} by
	default.

    - Fixed build errors under linux.

    - Fixed {Dos9_RunFile()} command to be able to detect failures due to non
    existant file or no executable files under UNIX compatible operating
    systems.

    - Introduced the {%DOS9_START_SCRIPT%} variable which must contain a
    path to a script or a program to handle mymetype associations on
    Unix compatible platform.

    - Added URI support to {START} command.

    - Fixed {CTRC-C} handling under UNIX compatible system.

{{Monday 11th}}

    - Added line editing capabilities under linux, through the use of a
    slightly modified version of {linenoise}. Linenoise is tiny library
    allowing console line editing. The license is shipped in COPYING.linenoise.

    - Added a big change in the way blocks and {FOR} and {IF} commands are
    handled. Now {IF} and {FOR} look ahead in the command line to see if
    anything is to be executed using conditional operators. By default, {IF}
    and {FOR} swallow everything to the left of the command. That is:

${for %%a in (foo bar) do echo %%a & echo loop}

    @- is now equivalent to:

${for %%a in (foo bar) do (echo %%a & echo loop)}

    @- This behaviour is more compatible with {cmd.exe}. To override the default
    behaviour, please enclose the {FOR} command inside a command block as
    follows:

${(for %%a in (foo bar) do echo %%a) & echo loop}

    - Incorporated some utf-8 fixes to the linenoise library.

{{Wednesday 21st}}

    - Added a little fix to prevent dos9 from executing line starting with a
    column after delayed expansion.

    - Do not exit when a label is encountered inside a block.

	- Fixed {START} command error when trying to launch an external batch script.


{{Wednesday 27th}}

	- Added lots of manual pages.

	- Changed the way script are loaded and line executed to be more compatible with cmd.exe.

	- Fixes to the thread library.

{{Friday, 29th}}

	- Fixed bug involving pipes and wrongly inherited file descriptors
	created after a call to {dup()}.

{{Monday 2nd, July}}

	- Implemented {hlp}'s {help} alias as a part of {Dos9_Auto.bat}.

	- New implementation of the {dump} command.

	- New makefiles for gettext files.

{{Tuesday 3rd}}

    - Added new target {/O:MD} for {TEA} that output markdown files. This is
    very usefull as it helps providing more readable documentations on git
    repositories.

    - Fixed build errors for {DUMP}.

    - Added {en} locale to the {po} directory and added a few fixes to make
    the translation system easier to handle.

	- Updated {README} file. It is now generated from a template used by
	the git repository and the website so that information can be easily
	synced. However some preprocessing is required in order to remove
	unnecessary broken links from {README.tea}. {README.tea} is generated
	through a template {README.tpl}.

{{Wednesday 4th}}

    - Added the {%~f} options to special variables.

    - Updated the local variables man pages.

    - Fixed a bug with {START} command. Since the output of {dos9_start} was
    redirected to {NUL}, and the process was not awaited, it caused problem
    when either {mimeopen} or {xdg-open} was trying to interact with user.
    To fix the problem, the output is no longer redirected and dos9 waits
    for {dos9_start} completion. This might cause little inconveniences as
    both {xdg-open} and {mimeopen} produce some output even when run
    without errors, but this is the only workaround found yet.

{{Saturday, 7th}}

    - Fixed few errors with the {DUMP} command.

    - Fixed capitalised letters used inside a {#include} statement in
    {Dos9_UnicodeDir.c}

	- Added translation for Hindi thanks to {Karanveer Chouhan (aka kvc)}.

	- Added a tiny test suite system.

	- Fixed {SET /a} bugs reported by DrNuget on the discord conversation.
	There was essentially two bugs:

		-- the {-=} operator was mistakenly handled by {Dos9} as the {/=}
		which obviously led to unexpected behaviours.

		-- Additional spaces between the variable name and the assignment
		operator were not ignored whenever an assignment other than {=}
		was specified, leading to errors computing the result.

	- Fixed a tiny error with {femto} so that configuration target can
	be specified in a single line.

{{Sunday 15th}}

	- Modified po Makefiles to stop auto-rebuild problems.

	- Modified dir and variables to fix locale date formatting problems
	and added proper setlocale.

{{Monday 16th}}

	- Fixed a little bug in the {Dos9_GetNextBlockBeginEx()} function.

	- Added {PROMPT} command and {%PROMPT%} variable.

	- Added the {PECHO} command which consists of an echo command using
	prompt formats.

	- Moved the introduction message to {Dos9_Auto.bat}.

	- Fixes to {dos9 variables} manual pages.

	- Modified {COLOR} to handle new {.} extension, which refer to the
	current default color.

	- Modified the behaviour of libcu8 history.

{{Tuesday 17th}}

	- Fixed remaining with msgmerge that was not properly updating the
	timestanp of generated files.

	- Changed {Dos9_Ask()} input source to avoid potential conflicts
	with buffering.

	- Added bash-like auto-complete features for windows platforms,
	still experimental though.

    - Fixed errors on colors associations to code when using Unix-based
    operating systems. Sadly this means this feature has been broken for
    quit a long time.

    - Added bash-like auto-complete features for Unix-based operating system
    based on linenoise. There is still some concerns that this might be broken
    on platforms with console interraction dissabled.

    - Slightly modified {Dos9_AskConfirmation()} function to be able to
    specify some special input function in order to avoid conflicts with
    standard buffering or raw mode.

{{Saturday 21st}}

	- Fixed missing inclusion of <stddef.h> in {Dos9_Ask.h}.

	- Fixed {libcu8_read()} function problem handling some characters that
	consume more than one monospaced width. Such characters can be found using
	{NSimSum} font on windows systems (for example, the {§}).

	- Added {$P$G} as default {%PROMPT%} value, just in case there is no
	{Dos9_Auto.bat} script available.

	- Added an alternate prompt for multi-line input.

	- Fixed missing preprocessor directives inside {linenoise/linenoise.c} today
	exclude {windows} targets.

{{Thursday 24th}}

	- Added the ESC key shortcut to clear the command under windows platforms.

	- Added {dist} makefile target to make a zip of the {bin} folder when called.

{{Saturday 4th, August}}

	- Fixed few warnings.

	- Include Dos9_DirStack.h to Dos9_Core.h.

{{Monday 6th, August}}

	when {no-nls} was used to configure the femto build suite.

	- Fixed {CD} outdated manual page.

{{Wednesday 8th}}

	- Fixed a bug causing a segfault when using the {DIR} command.

{{Friday 10th}}

	- Implemented a better support to {UNC} paths. Such paths can not
	be used by {CD} for now.

{{Saturday 11th}}

	- Implement a new behaviour for {XARGS} command. Each line of the
	input is interpreted as a single parameter. Thus whenever a line
	containing delimiters and not surrounded by quotes is encountered,
	quotes are automatically added.

{{Wednesday 15th}}

    - Fixed documentation errors on {Special variable} expansions.

{{Friday 17th}}

    - Added the {TIMEOUT} command.

	- Modified the way {Dos9} set locale so that the subject LC_NUMERIC
	(that is, everything refering to numbers) are not affected by the
	change.

{{Sunday 19th}}

    - Fixed an error introduced some commit ago that caused file search
    functions that caused a '/' to be added before the '/' root sign when
    using linux.

    - Fixed an error with linenoise custom autocompletion mecanism not adding
    a final '\0' character to the line, resulting in buffer overflows.

    - Fixes to manual pages.

    - Fixes to non-unicode windows version.

    - Fixes to manual pages generation systems.

{{Wednesday 22nd}}

    - Fixed scripts makefiles.

    - Fixed a bug with Dos9_AskConfirmation keyboard routine.

{{Sunday 26th}}

	- Fixed a bug with serialisation of sub process creation. Indeed, as Dos9
	is multi-threaded, many different process can be creating at nearly the
	same time, causing file inheritance issues with pipes.

	- Fixed a bug with history completion.

	- Fixed an error with the disk parameter {%~d} with special variables.

{{Monday 1st, October}}

    - Fixed a bug where the closing parenthesis was not recognised as a
    delimiter for files names when using redirections.

{{Wednesday 3rd}}

    - Fixed an annoying bug of the windows version that used autocompletion
    when prompting the user a question, resulting sometimes on unconvienient
    nested user prompts.

    - Added a mutex to serialize calls to the ECHO command between subthreads.
    Indeed before this, several simultaneous calls to ECHO resulted in
    interlaced messages, and garbage-like text.

    - Fixed an unitialized variable bug in the RMDIR command code.

{{Thursday 4th}}

    - Fixed redirections not being handled when combined with pipes.

	- Fixed shift command bug.

	- Fixed an error with special variable expansion.

{{Thursday 31st}}

	- Added the MOD command and a module toolkit to create simple
	dynamic link modules for Dos9. The object files to build modules
	can be found in modules/lib and a very simple sample module is
	available in modules/sample.

{{Sunday 3rd, November}}

	- Fixed a bug of block parsing preventing proper handling of
	redirections when mixed with top-level blocks.

	- Slight fixes to MOD and module apis.

	- Lots of changes to the console apis of libDos9, changed functions
	to require stream as argument and got rid of the duplicated functions
	inside Dos9 and initialisation functions

	- Added an experimental batbox module.

{{Sunday 11st}}

	- Fixed PAUSE command misuse of Dos9_Getch().

	- Fixed omitted thread locale attribute within MORE command code.

	- Fixed Dos9_GetVar() and Dos9_UnEscape() functions which happenned
	to be very slow on very large inputs.

	- Modified ESTR* lib to extend buffer exponentially rather linearly.

	- Added functions to the batbox module.

{{Thursday, 29th}}

	- Added 'no-modules' options to build Dos9 without module support on
	platforms that do not provide it.

	- Fixed THANKS file to thank Xenoxis for his contribution to the
	codebase with the {VER} command.

	- Slightly modified the internationalization semantics used by
	Dos9 in order to fix slight Windows issue related to some message
	containing '\\n' that were not translated to '\\r\\n'. The semantics
	have been changed, in order to fix this issue, as follows (this is
	further discussed in GUIDELINES):

		-- Help messages have '\\n' translated to the appropriate sequences
		on the fly, so these may still contain newlines.

		-- On the other hand, both normal and error message must not
		contain any newline. Furthermore, it up to the command to print
		appropriate sequences using DOS9_NL when displaying a normal message.

{{Sunday 1st, December}}

    - Fixed a bug preventing DOS9_COLOR_DEFAULT to work on unix-compatible
    operating systems.

    - Fixed omitted libdl link flag inside Dos9's makefile.

{{Saturday 8th, December}}

		- Improved femto by adding femto-clean and by using femto-test.out to avoid
		using compiler-default file output (such as a.exe or a.out).

		- Removed dump.h from git repository (which is useless since it is
		automatically generated with platform-specific values).

		- Fixed ${make bin} build without prior ${make all}.

{{Thursday 13rd}}

	- Changed name of {TEST_*_PATH()} macro families to {DOS9_TEST_*_PATH()}
	to add more consistency to the source code.

	- Removed old outdated man page reffering to dropped external commands.

	- Added a fix to the batbox modules to make color codes portable across
	all supported platforms.

	- Fixed man page typos.

	- Added manual page for the {VER} command.

	- Added manual page for the {MOD} command.

{{Sunday 15th, December}}

    - Fixed searching issues with hlp script and implemented {help /l}.

    - Fixed a little bug that caused %PATH% search functions to loop through
    %PATH% files even when given a relative path.

    - Changed the behaviour of the {MOD} command. Modules are now search by
    default inside {%DOS9_PATH%/modules} (rather that in the whole {%PATH%}
    directories), unless if the module file name is absolute; in that case
    {MOD} uses the file referred to by the absolute path.

    - Fixed a bug of {SET /a:f}. When expression contained spaces, the return
    value was systematically 0.

{{Monday 16th, December}}

    - Improved consistency between {command /?}, now {dos9 /?} and {dump /?} use
      stderr/fError instead of stdout as output (which is more consistent with
      internal commands).

{{Monday 24th}}

	- Fixed set /p not providing history features under both windows and 
	unices.
	
	- Switched to version 218.3 
	
{{Thursday 27th}}

	- Fixed missing documentation for {batbox} modules. Modified {README}
	and {GUIDELINES}.
	
	- Fixed missing static qualifiers in libDos9.

    - Fixed recursive file search under Linux and non-unicode windows.

    - Fixed a bug with {%~d} under *nices causing double root symbol on
    paths.
	
{{Monday, Junuary 14th}}

	- Added {src-dist} target to {Makefile} to automatically build source
	code tarballs ready to be distributed and/or uploaded on the website.
	
	- Fixed a bug involving {Dos9_RunBlock()} not parsing blocks correctly.
	
{{Thursday 17th}}

	- Finally fixed {hlp.bat} to make it able to be run from any directory,
	especially when the said directory names contains parenthesis or
	spaces (what is very often the case under windows).
	
{{Monday, May 1st, 2020}}

	- Fixed a double declaration inside the code of libinteval.

{{Wednesday, May 3rd, 2020}}

	- Fixed hlp bug with Dos9 on another drive than user directory on Windows.
